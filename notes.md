# linkedin post:
I programmatically transformed ~300 of my personal photographs in the styles of Andy Warhol, Frida Kahlo, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Vincent van Gogh. In total, I generated about 1,800 images for ~$120 in API credits—and I built a site from scratch to share them. I’m deeply proud of this project—it feels like a milestone in my journey, and so I’m excited to share it with you and would love to hear your feedback!
