create simple landing page

## ALL ORGANIZED!!
only creative things to work on = experiment with sora / dalle in chatgpt / upscaling apis / openai api +
add custom components


## technical
best way to serve (width, quality, staticprops, prefetching)

squarespace store?

## todo
this is fucking rediculous the goal is havea script where i can put in an image url and prompt and get a varaition to generate, save to ai bucket, and save metadata as a parent
then i also need 
little functions. 
image url -> image id.
image id -> image url
image id -> all children
image id -> root parent
for every image.
for every image in a folder
for all images, check if they have metadata, otherwise create a metadata row
for all metadata rows, if no description, generate description

should really understand chatgpt image apis, not just confusing chatgpt slop.

learn to build.
