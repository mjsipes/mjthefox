## The Journey Behind the Tech
4 years ago i created a photo website
now it is my coming of age / time to create from scratch
used nextjs / supabase
image quality and size versus image speed tradeoff
-supabase transformations / nextjs Image components / supabase nextjs image loader
-prefetching html versus remote links, getstaticprops, squarespace does a great job at this, hard to replicate and not good documentation online for best practices. struggled with trying to use the framework versus going rogue
- openai images versus responses endpoint
- caching in browser / network tab / hard reloads
- image format / using file system . basae64.
- image transformations on the fly = wrong

creating a nondestructive database that grows with my project. we do not know how this app will transform, but never deleting from the database ex? large and small.
prefetching

cool idea of style transfer for images

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Backend**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) + [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **AI**: [OpenAI Images API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images) for style transfer
- **Hosting**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
