New Photo Website!!!

## The Journey Behind the Tech
4 years ago i created a photo website with squarespace
now i create from scratch with supabase + nextjs

two step process for my app. step 
1: recreate my squarespace website. 
2: add to it in ways I was incapable of previously

1: current comparison: https://mjthefox.com/
https://gar-bassoon-8hk7.squarespace.com/
my image quality and beutiful display is great so happy about that, but squarespace is faster, they do better image optimization and prefetching which i must work on. so very impressive square space!


2: decided to pay 100 dollars to transform 300 of my personal photographs into paintings from culturally significant artists.
openai has two options: images endpoint and responses endpoint - studied / learned about these two endpoints. chose images endpoint
created program to to batch process my images, store resulting images, and link them to original image with postgres.

TODO:
make website faster: cache ai image metadata, remove supabase image transformations, use image thumbnails
